# Practice Problem 1.2

The marketing department at your company has promised your customers that the next software release will show a $2\times$ performance improvement. You have been assigned the task of delivering on that promise. You have determined that only 80% of the system can be improved. How much (i.e., what value of $k$) would you need to improve this part to meet the overall performance target?

## Answer

The new time would have to be half the old time, so we would need 0.8 to become 0.3 (we cannot change the other 0.2). Thus the factor is:

$$
k = \frac{0.8}{0.3} = 2.\bar{6}
$$

Alternatively, we can use the formula for Almdahl's Law directly:

$$
S = \frac{1}{(1 - \alpha) + \alpha / k}
2 = \frac{1}{0.2 + 0.8/k}
1/2 = 0.2 + 0.8/k
0.8/k = 0.3
k = 8/3
$$
