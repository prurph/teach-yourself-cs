# Practice Problem 2.39

How could we modify the expression for form B for the case where bit position `n` is the most significant bit?

## Answer

Form B is: `(x<<(n+1)) - (x<<m)`. When `n` is the most significant bit, then `n + 1 = w`. Right-shifting any value by its word size yields all zeros, so the expression becomes: `0 - (x<<m) = -(x<<m)`
