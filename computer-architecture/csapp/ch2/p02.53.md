# Practice Problem 2.53

Fill in the following macro definitions to generate the double-precision values $+\infinity$, $-\infinity$, and $-0$:

You cannot use any include files (such as `math.h`), but you can make use of the fact that the largest finite number that can be represented with double precision is around $1.8 \times 10^{308}$

## Answer

Pick a number that overflows for positive infinity. Derive the others from it.

```c
#define POS_INFINITY 1e500
#define NEG_INFINITY (-POS_INFINITY)
#define NEG_ZERO (-1.0/POS_INFINITY)
```
