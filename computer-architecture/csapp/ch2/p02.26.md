# Practice Problem 2.26

You are given the assignment of writing a function that determines whether one string is longer than another. You decide to make use of the string library function `strlen` having the following declaration:

```c
/* Prototype for library function strlen */
size_t strlen(const char *s);
```

Here is your first attempt at the function:

```c
/* Determine whether string s is longer than string t */
/* WARNING: This function is buggy */
int strlonger(char *s, char *t) {
    return strlen(s) - strlen(t) > 0;
}
```

When you investigate this on some sample data, things do not seem to work quite right. You investigate further and determine that, when compiled as a 32-bit program, data type `size_t` is defined (via `typedef`) in header file `stdio.h` to be `unsigned`

## A

For what cases will this function produce an incorrect result?

### Answer

Any case where the length of `t` is greater than the length of `s`. It is impossible for `unsigned` to represent negative numbers, so the function can only return false when the lengths are equal.

## B

Explain how this incorrect result comes about.

### Answer

The subtraction is interpreted as an unsigned value because s and t are unsigned, and thus the comparison is also performed as unsigned. For example:

```
s = "CHERRY"
t = "WATERMELON"

strlen(s) = 6  = 0110
strlen(t) = 10 = 1010

strlen(s) - strlen(t) = 1100
```

This value is interpreted as unsigned, so `1100 > 0` returns true, erroneously indicating `s` is longer than `t`

## C

Show how to fix this code so it will work reliably.

### Answer

Make a direct comparison between the lengths.

```c
int strlonger(char *s, char *t) {
    return strlen(s) > strlen(t);
}
```
