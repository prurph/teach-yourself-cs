# Practice Problem 2.54

Assume variables `x`, `f`, and `d`, are of type `int`, `float`, and `double`, respectively. Their values are arbitrary, except that neither `f` nor `d` equals $+\infinity$, $-\infinity$, or $NaN$. For each of the following C expressions, either argue that it will always be true (i.e., evaluate to 1) or give a value for the variables such that it is not true (i.e., evaluates to 0).

## A

`x == (int)(double) x`

### Answer

True, `double` can represent more than the range of `int`.

## B

`x == (int)(float) x`

### Answer

False, `x == TMax`

## C

`d == (double)(float) d`

### Answer

False, when `d == 1e50` casting to `float` gives $+\infinity$

## D

`f == (float)(double) f`

### Answer

True, `double` has more range and precision than `float`.

## E

`f == -(-f)`

### Answer

True. This is simply flipping the sign bit.

## F

`1.0/2 == 1/2.0`

### Answer

True. 1.0 and 2.0 can be exactly represented as floats.

## G

`d * d >= 0.0`

### Answer

True. Floating point multiplication satisfies $a *^f \ge 0$ if $a \neq NaN$. The result may overflow to $+\infinity$, but comparisons to infinity are properly handled.

## H

`(f + d) - f == d`

### Answer

False. `f == 1e15; d == 10.0`. `f + d` is rounded to 1e15, so the left side becomes 0.0 while the right is 10.0.
