# Practice Problem 2.29

Fill in the following table in the style of Figure 2.25. Give the integer values of the 5-bit arguments, the values of both their integer and two’s-complement sums, the bit-level representation of the two’s-complement sum, and the case from the derivation of Equation 2.13.

## Answer

| $x$         | $y$         | $x+y$        | $x+_{5}^{t}\textrm{y}$ | Case                       |
| :--         | :--         | :--          | :--                    | :--                        |
| [10100] -12 | [10001] -15 | [100101] -27 | [00101]  5             | 1 (Negative overflow)      | 
| [11000] -8  | [11000] -8  | [110000] -16 | [10000] -16            | 2 (Within negative bounds) | 
| [10111] -9  | [01000]  8  | [11111]  -1  | [11111] -1             | 2 (Within negative bounds) | 
| [00010]  2  | [00101]  5  | [00111]   7  | [00111]  7             | 3 (Within positive bounds) | 
| [01100]  12 | [00100]  4  | [010000]  16 | [10000] -16            | 4 (Positive overflow)      |
