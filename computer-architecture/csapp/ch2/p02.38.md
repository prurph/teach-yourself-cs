# Practice Problem 2.38

As we will see in Chapter 3, the `LEA` instruction can perform computations of the form `(a<<k) + b`, where `k` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `b` is either 0 or some program value. The compiler often uses this instruction to perform multiplications by constant factors. For example, we can compute `3*a` as `(a<<1)+a`.

Considering cases where `b` is either 0 or equal to `a`, and all possible values of `k`, what multiples of `a` can be computed with a single `LEA` instruction?

## Answer

| `k` | `b` | `LEA` |
|:--  |:--  |:--    |
| 0   | 0   | `a`   |
| 0   | `a` | `2a`  |
| 1   | 0   | `2a`  |
| 1   | `a` | `3a`  |
| 2   | 0   | `4a`  |
| 2   | `a` | `5a`  |
| 3   | 0   | `8a`  |
| 3   | `a` | `9a`  |
