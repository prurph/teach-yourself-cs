# Practice Problem 2.37

You are given the task of patching the vulnerability in the XDR code shown in the aside on page 136 for the case where both data types int and `size_t` are 32 bits. You decide to eliminate the possibility of the multiplication overflowing by computing the number of bytes to allocate using data type `uint64_t`. You replace the original call to `malloc` (line 9) as follows:

```c
uint64_t asize =
    ele_cnt * (uint64_t) ele_size;
void *result = malloc(asize);
```
Recall that the argument to malloc has type `size_t`.

## A

Does your code provide any improvement over the original?

### Answer

No, it is still possible to overflow the buffer malloc expects int on a 32-bit system, so it will be truncated.

## B

How would you change the code to eliminate the vulnerability?

### Answer

Check for overflow before allocating:

```c
if (!tmult_ok((int) ele_cnt, (int) ele_size)) {
    return NULL;
} 
void *result = malloc(ele_cnt * ele_size);
```
