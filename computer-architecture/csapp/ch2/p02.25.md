# Practice Problem 2.25

Consider the following code that attempts to sum the elements of an array a, where the number of elements is given by parameter length:

```c
/* WARNING: This is buggy code */
float sum_elements(float a[], unsigned length) {
    int i;
    float result = 0;

    for (i = 0; i <= length-1; i++)
        result += a[i];
    return result;
}
```

When run with argument length equal to 0, this code should return 0.0. Instead, it encounters a memory error. Explain why this happens. Show how this code can be corrected.

## Answer

The loop condition compares `int i` to `length-1`. For both the subtraction and the comparison step, the signed operands are converted to unsigned because `length` is unsigned. This gives (shown with one-byte values for clarity):

$$
i    \le length - 1
0000 \le 0000   - 1
0000 \le 1111
$$

Since the comparison is treated as unsigned, it is true (the signed case we were expecting would instead amount to $0 \le -1$, which is false). Consequently the loop runs, causing an error trying to access indices of a that do not exist. Note in the absence of this error, the loop would run infinitely because the comparison is effectively $i \le UMax$, which is always true.

The code can be fixed by making length signed, or changing the loop condition to `i < length`.
