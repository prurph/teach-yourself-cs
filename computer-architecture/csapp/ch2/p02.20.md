# Practice Problem 2.20

Explain how Equation 2.5 applies to the entries in the table you generated when solving Problem 2.19.

## Answer

Equation 2.5 is:

$$
T2U_w(x) = \left\{
\begin{matrix}
 x + 2^w, & x < 0   \\
 x,       & x \ge 0
\end{matrix}
\right.
$$

This demonstrates that non-negative numbers are the same as their unsigned counterparts, whereas to convert a negative signed number to positive you add $2^w$. This is because the sign bit in unsigned represents $2^{w-1}$ instead of $-2^{w-1}$, so the change is $2*2^{w-1} = 2^w$.
