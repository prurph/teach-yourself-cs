# Practice Problem 2.44

Assume data type int is 32 bits long and uses a twoâ€™s-complement representation for signed values. Right shifts are performed arithmetically for signed values and logically for unsigned values. The variables are declared and initialized as follows:

```c
int x = foo(); /* Arbitrary value */
int y = bar(); /* Arbitrary value */
unsigned ux = x;
unsigned uy = y;
```
For each of the following C expressions, either (1) argue that it is true (evaluates to 1) for all values of x and y, or (2) give values of x and y for which it is false (evaluates to 0):

## A

`(x > 0) || (x-1 < 0)`

### Answer

False. If `x = TMin` then `x - 1` overflows to TMax.

## B

`(x & 7) != 7 || (x<<29 < 0)`

### Answer

True. If `(x & 7) == 7` it implies that the lower three bits of `x` are `111`. Shifting these 29 to the right will put a one in the sign bit, so `(x<<29 < 0)` will be true.

## C

`(x * x) >= 0`

### Answer

False. Any number such that $2^{31} \ge x^2 < 2^{32}$ will be represented with a 1 in the sign bit (2^{31} position), and therefore be a negative signed number. For example $16000 * 16000 = 0b10000000000011001100110011000100$

## D

`x < 0 || -x <= 0`

### Answer

True. If $x > 0$, then $-x < 0$.

## E

`x > 0 || -x >= 0`

### Answer

False. $0 > -TMin = TMin < 0$.

## F

x+y == uy+ux

### Answer

True. Signed and unsigned addition are commutative, so `x+y == y+x` and `uy+ux == ux+uy`, and operate identically at the bit level, therefore `x+y == ux+uy == uy+ux`.

## G

`x*~y + uy*ux == -x`

### Answer

True. `-y = ~y + 1`, so the above expression becomes `-xy - x + uy*ux`. Then, unsigned and signed multiplication are identical at the bit level, so `uy*ux = y*x`. Substituting gives `-xy - x + yx = -x`.
