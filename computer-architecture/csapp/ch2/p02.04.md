# Practice Problem 2.4

Without converting the numbers to decimal or binary, try to solve the following arithmetic problems, giving the answers in hexadecimal. *Hint:* Just modify the methods you use for performing decimal addition and subtraction to use base 16.

## A

$$
0x503c + 0x8 = 0x5044
$$

From $C + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20 = 16 + 4$, or 4 with a carry of 1.

## B

$$
0x503c - 0x40 = 0x4ffc
$$

Subtract 4 from 3 in the second positon: borrow 16 from 5, making it 4 and second position a 16. Then borrow 1 from that 16 for the second position, meaning the second position is calculated as 16+3-4 = 15 = F.

## C

$$
0x503c + 64 = 0x507c
$$

From 64 = 0x40

## D

$$
0x50ea - 0x503c = 0xae
$$

Borrow from second digit: a + 16 = 26 - c = 26 - 12 = 14 = e
Then for second digit: d - 3 = 13 - 3 = 10 = a
