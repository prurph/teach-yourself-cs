# Practice Problem 2.41

For a run of ones starting at bit position $n$ down to bit position $m$ ($n \ge m$), we saw that we can generate two forms of code, A and B. How should the compiler decide which form to use?

## Answer

When $n = m$, choose Form A

- Form A: one shift
- Form B: two shifts and a subtraction

When $n = m + 1$, choose either, assuming addition and subtraction take comparable cycles

- Form A: two shifts and one addition
- Form B: two shifts and one subtraction

When $n > m + 1$, choose Form B

- Form A: $n - m + 1 > 2$ shifts and $n - m$ additions
- Form B: two shifts and one subtraction
