# Practice Problem 2.6

Using `show_int` and `show_float`, we determine that the integer 3510593 has hexadecimal representation 0x00359141, while the floating-point number 3510593.0 has hexadecimal representation 0x4A564504.

## A

Write the binary representation of these two hexadecimal values.

### Answer

```
0x 0    0    3    5    9    1    4    1
   0000 0000 0011 0101 1001 0001 0100 0001

0x 4    A    5    6    4    5    0    4
   0100 1010 0101 0110 0100 0101 0000 0100
```

## B

Shift these two strings relative to one another to maximize the number of matching bits. How many bits match?

### Answer

21 bits match when the floating point is shifted two to the right.

```
00000000001101011001000101000001
           |||||||||||||||||||||
  01001010010101100100010100000100
```

## C

What parts of the strings do not match?

### Answer

All of the integer bits appear in the floating point (as part of its lower 23 bits, which are the mantissa), except for the MSB 1 of the integer. The higher-order bits of the floating point do not match.
