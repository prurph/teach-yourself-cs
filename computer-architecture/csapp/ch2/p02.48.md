# Practice Problem 2.48

As mentioned in Problem 2.6, the integer 3,510,593 has hexadecimal representation `0x00359141`, while the single-precision floating-point number 3,510,593.0 has hexadecimal representation `0x4A564504`. Derive this floating-point representation and explain the correlation between the bits of the integer and floating-point representations.

## Answer

Determine the binary representation of `0x00359141`, then shift:

```
0x 0    0    3    5    9    1    4    1
   0000 0000 0011 0101 1001 0001 0100 0001
              1.1 0101 1001 0001 0100 0001 * 2^21
```

Break this into fractional and exponent fields using the formula $V = (-1)^s \times M \times 2^E$. For this case: $V = (-1)^0 * 1.10101... * 2^21$ from above.

- The sign bit is zero (this is a positive number)
- $M = 1.101011... = 1.frac$ (this is a normalized number because of the leading 1)
    - Find frac by dropping leading `1.` and pad to 23 bits (single-precision is 1, 8, 23 bits)
    - Because we can fit all the represented bits in those 23, this will be an exact representation
- $E = 21 = e - Bias$
    - Thus $e = 21 + 127 = 148$

Now represent fractional and exponent in binary:

```
f = 10101100100010100000100
e = 10010100
```

Finally the floating point is these two plus the sign bit. This matches the expected hexadecimal value.

```
3510593.0 = 0100 1010 0101 0110 0100 0101 0000 0100
          = 4    A    5    6    4    5    0    4    
```

Lining up the bits:

```
              seeeeeeeefffffffffffffffffffffff
3510593.0 =   01001010010101100100010100000100
                       *********************
3510593   = 00000000001101011001000101000001
```

The lower integer bits line up with the fractional bits up to the most significant bit equal to 1 in the integer, which is the implied leading 1 from the normalized representation. Cool!
