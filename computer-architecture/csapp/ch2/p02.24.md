# Practice Problem 2.24

Suppose we truncate a 4-bit value (represented by hex digits `0` through `F`) to a 3-bit value (represented as hex digits `0` through `7`.) Fill in the table below showing the effect of this truncation for some cases, in terms of the unsigned and twoâ€™s- complement interpretations of those bit patterns.

## Answer

### Hex

| Original | Truncated |
| :--      | :--       |
| 0        | 0         |
| 2        | 2         |
| 9        | 1         |
| B        | 3         |
| F        | 7         |

### Unsigned

Interpreted as an unsigned value, the truncation is $original \mod 2^3$ as per Equation 2.9

| Original | Truncated |
| :--      | :--       |
| 0        | 0         |
| 2        | 2         |
| 9        | 1         |
| 11       | 3         |
| 15       | 7         |

### Signed

Per Equation 2.10, the truncation happens, then the value is interpreted as the two's complement of $\mod 8$. The first operation gives a value between 0 and 7, then conversion to two's complement maps this to 3 to -4.

| Original | Truncated |
| :--      | :--       |
|  0       |  0        |
|  2       |  2        |
| -7       |  1        |
| -5       |  3        |
| -1       | -1        |
