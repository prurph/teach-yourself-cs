# Practice Problem 2.32

You are assigned the task of writing code for a function `tsub_ok`, with arguments `x` and `y`, that will return 1 if computing $x-y$ does not cause overflow. Having just written the code for Problem 2.30, you write the following:

```c
/* Determine whether arguments can be subtracted without overflow */
/* WARNING: This code is buggy. */
int tsub_ok(int x, int y) {
    return tadd_ok(x, -y);
}
```

For what values of x and y will this function give incorrect results? Writing a correct version of this function is left as an exercise (Problem 2.74).

## Answer

When `y` is $TMin$, then `-y` also equals $TMin$. This can be seen as: `~[1000] + 1 = [1000]` (negate with two's-complement plus one) or by the definition of the additive inverse as something that, when added to $TMin$, gives 0.

$$
TMin_w + ^_{w}_{t}TMin_w = 0
TMin_w + TMin_w = -2^{w-1} + -2^{w-1} = -2^w = 0
$$

Above $-2^w$ overflows to zero, thus $TMin_w + TMin_w = 0$, and $TMin_w$ is therefore its own additive inverse: $TMin = -TMin$.

In the case that `y` is $TMin$:

- When `x` is nonnegative, there _will be overflow_, but `tadd_ok` will return 0
- When `x` is negative, there _will not be overflow_, but because $x + TMin <= 0$ in this case, `tadd_ok` will erroneously return 1000

In short, the function is backwards when `y` is $TMin$.
