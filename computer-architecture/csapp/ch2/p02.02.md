# Practice Problem 2.2

Fill in the blank entries in the following table, giving the decimal and hexadecimal representations of different powers of 2:

## Answer

A useful trick is to remember $2^n$ in binary is a $1$ followed by $n$ zeros, and that a hex zero is four binary zeros. Therefore exact multiples of four zeros like 2^4 become 0x10, 2^5 is 0x20 (because hex 2 is 10 in binary), etc.


| n   | 2^n (decimal) | 2^n (hexadecimal) |
| :-- | :--           | :--               |
| 9   | 512           | 0x200             |
| 19  | 524288        | 0x80000           |
| 14  | 16384         | 0x4000            |
| 16  | 65536         | 0x10000           |
| 17  | 131072        | 0x20000           |
| 5   | 32            | 0x20              |
| 7   | 128           | 0x80              |
