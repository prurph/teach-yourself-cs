# Practice Problem 2.21

Assuming the expressions are evaluated when executing a 32-bit program on a machine that uses two's-complement arithmetic, fill in the following table describing the effect of casting and relational operations, in the style of Figure 2.19:

## Answer

Arithmetic operations have precedence, so conversion happens there first if required.

| Expression                       | Type     | Evaluation            |
| :--                              | :--      | :--                   |
| `-2147483647-1  ==  2147483648U` | Unsigned | 1 (100..0 == 100..0)  |
| `-2147483647-1  <   2147483647`  | Signed   | 1 (TMin < TMax)       |
| `-2147483647-1U <   2147483647`  | Unsigned | 0 (111..00 > 011..1)  |
| `-2147483647-1  <  -2147483647`  | Signed   | 1 (TMin < TMin + 1)   |
| `-2147483647-1U <  -2147483647`  | Unsigned | 1 (111..00 < 111..10) |
