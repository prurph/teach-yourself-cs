# Practice Problem 2.51

We saw in Problem 2.46 that the Patriot missile software approximated 0.1 as $x = 0.00011001100110011001100_2$. Suppose instead that they had used IEEE round-to-even mode to determine an approximation $x{}'$ to 0.1 with 23 bits to the right of the binary point.

## A

What is the binary representation of $x{}'$?

### Answer

The unrounded value has $[1100]$ repeating:

$x = 0.00011001100110011001100[1100]_2$

This rounds up because it is closer to $...1101$ than $...1100$:

$x{}' = 0.00011001100110011001101_2$

## B

What is the approximate decimal value of $x{}' - 0.1$?

### Answer

The binary representation of $0.1 = 0.000110011[0011]$ repeating at the end, so subtracting gives:

```
  0.00011001100110011001101
- 0.000110011001100110011001100110011
  0.0000000000000000000000000[1100]
```

There are 25 zeroes in front of the repeating $[1100]$, so we can approximate this as 0.1 shifted right 22 times (because it has three leading zeroes already before the repeat):

$x{}' - 0.1 \approx 0.0000000000000000000000000[1100]_2 \approx 0.1 * 2^{-22} \approx 2.38 * 10^{-8}$

## C

How far off would the computed clock have been after 100 hours of operation?

### Answer

The error gets applied every 0.1 seconds so:

$100 * 60 * 60 * 10 * 2.38 * 10^{-8} \approx 0.086 seconds$

## D

How far off would the program's prediction of the position of the Scud missile have been?

### Answer

The missile travels at about 2000 m/s so:

$0.086 s * 2000 m/s \approx 171 m$
