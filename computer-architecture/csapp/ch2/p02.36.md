# Practice Problem 2.36

For the case where data type `int` has 32 bits, devise a version of `tmult_ok` (Problem 2.35) that uses the 64-bit precision of data type `int64_t` without using division.

## Answer

```c
/* Determine whether arguments can be multiplied without overflow */
int tmult_ok(int x, int y) {
    /* Must cast result on right side, otherwise multiplication
       occurs as 32-bit and then is extended */
    int64_t p = (int64_t) x*y;
    /* If there was no overflow, truncating back to 32-bit preserves value */
    return p == (int) p;
}
```
