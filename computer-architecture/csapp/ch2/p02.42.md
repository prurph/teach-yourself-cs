# Practice Problem 2.42

Write a function `div16` that returns the value `x/16` for integer argument `x`. Your function should not use division, modulus, multiplication, any conditionals (`if` or `?:`), any comparison operators (e.g., `<`, `>`, or `==`), or any loops. You may assume the data type `int` is 32 bits long and uses a `two's-complement` representation, and that right shifts are performed arithmetically.

## Answer

Negative numbers must be biased by $2^4 - 1$. `x >> 31` gives all ones for negative numbers, and all zeros for positive numbers; this can then be bitwise `&` with 15 (`0xF`) to give the correct bias for each case.

```c
int div16(int x) {
    int bias = (x >> 31) & 0xF;
    return (x + bias) >> 4;
}
```
