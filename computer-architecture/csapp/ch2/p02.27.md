# Practice Problem 2.27

Write a function with the following prototype:

```c
/* Determine whether arguments can be added without overflow */
int uadd_ok(unsigned x, unsigned y);
```

## Answer

```c
/* Determine whether arguments can be added without overflow */
int uadd_ok(unsigned x, unsigned y) {
    return x + y >= x;
}
```

This must be true if the value overflows because for overflow $s = x + y - 2^w$. Since the rightmost bit of these numbers represents $2^{w-1}$, it follows that $x, y < $2^w$ and therefore $y - 2^w < 0$ and $s = x + y - 2^w < x$.
