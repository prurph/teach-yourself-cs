# Practice Problem 2.31

Your coworker gets impatient with your analysis of the overflow conditions for twoâ€™s-complement addition and presents you with the following implementation of `tadd_ok`:

```c
/* Determine whether arguments can be added without overflow */
/* WARNING: This code is buggy. */
int tadd_ok(int x, int y) {
    int sum = x+y;
    return (sum-x == y) && (sum-y == x);
}
```
You look at the code and laugh. Explain why.

## Answer

Two's complement addition is associative and commutative (Abelian Group), therefore $(x+y)-x = (x - x) + y = y$, regardless of whether $x+y$ overflows or not.
