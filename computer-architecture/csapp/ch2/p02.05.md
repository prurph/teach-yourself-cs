# Practice Problem 2.5

Consider the following three calls to `show_bytes`:

```c
int val = 0x87654321;
byte_pointer valp = (byte_pointer) &val;
show_bytes(valp, 1); /* A. */
show_bytes(valp, 2); /* B. */
show_bytes(valp, 3); /* C. */
```

Indicate the values that will be printed by each call on a little-endian machine and on a big-endian machine

## A

In all cases, little endian starts with the least significant byte (21), whereas big endian starts with the most significant (87). The order of each byte is not changed, so it's "21 43", not "12 34".

Little endian: 21 
Big endian:    87

## B

Little endian: 21 43
Big endian:    87 65

## C

Little endian: 21 43 65 
Big endian:    87 65 43
