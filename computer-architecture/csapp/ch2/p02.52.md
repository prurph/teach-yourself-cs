# Practice Problem 2.52

Consider the following two 7-bit floating-point representations based on the IEEE floating-point format. Neither has a sign bitâ€”they can only represent nonnegative numbers.

## 1. Format A

There are $k = 3$ exponent bits. The exponent bias is 3.
There are $n = 4$ fraction bits.

## 2. Format B
There are $k = 4$ exponent bits. The exponent bias is 7.
There are $n = 3$ fraction bits.

Below, you are given some bit patterns in format A, and your task is to convert them to the closest value in format B. If necessary, you should apply the round-to- even rounding rule. In addition, give the values of numbers given by the format A and format B bit patterns. Give these as whole numbers (e.g., 17) or as fractions (e.g., 17/64).

## Answer

Sample calcultions, using $V = M \times 2^E$:

### For 011 0000

For normalized Format A, $E = e - Bias = e - 3$. Thus:

$$
101 1110      \\
e = 5         \\
M = 1.110_2   \\
E = e - 3 = 2 \\
V = 1.110_2 * 2^2 = 4 * (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8) = 4 * 15/8 = 15/2
$$

Then to convert to Format B, $E = e - Bias = e - 7 \rightarrow e = E + 7$

$$
15/2 = 7.5 = 0111.1
111.1 = 1.111 * 2^2
M = 1.111 \rightarrow frac = 111\
E = 2 \rightarrow e = 2 + 7 = 9 = 1001
1001 111
$$

The above is an exact value because no truncation of the fractional bits was required.

### For 010 1001

As above this is 25/32. Converting to Format B is a little trickier because there is rounding. First, represent 25/32 in binary. The way to do this is successively take powers $2^{-n}$, and if you have that much remaining, there's a 1 in that position, otherwise zero and keep going. Think of it as 0.78125 has one half in it, one quarter, no eigths, no sixteenths, and one thity-second:

$$
25/32 = 0.78125 = 1*0.5 + 1*0.25 + 0*0.125 + 0*0.0675 + 1*0.03125 = 0.11001
$$

Then we shift the decimal place so that $M$ is between 1 and 2 (normalized number):

$$
0.11001 = 1.1001 * 2^{-1}
E = -1 = e - bias = e - 7 \rightarrow e = 6 = 0110
M = 1.1001 \rightarrow frac = 1001
$$

So $frac = 1001$ but we only have three fractional bits. We round to the nearest even in this case: 100, so overall we have 0110 100.

### For 000 0001

This is denormalized ($e = 0$), so $E = 1 - bias = 1 - 3 = -2$. This gives (remember for denormalized there is no implied 1. on $M$):

$$
V = 0.0001 * 2^{-2} = 1/16 * 1/4 = 1/64
$$

Now to convert this to Format B:

$$
1/32 = 0.000001 = 1.0 * 2^{-6}
E = e - bias = e - 7 \rightarrow e = 1
M = 1.0 \rightarrow frac = 0
0001 000
$$

Note that if we tried to represent this as $0.1 * 2^{-5}$ (shifting one less), this would appear to be denormalized (exponent bits are 0), however for denormalized numbers, $E = 1 - bias = -6 \neq -5$, so this is not a valid representation of a denormalized Format B number.

| 101 1110      | 15/2           | 1001 111      | 15/2           |
| 010 1001      | 25/32          | 0110 100      | 3/4            |
| 110 1111      | 31/2           | 1011 000      | 16             |
| 000 0001      |  1/64          | 0001 000      | 1/64           |
