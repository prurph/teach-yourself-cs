# Practice Problem 2.40

For each of the following values of $K$, find ways to express $x * K$ using only the specified number of operations, where we consider both additions and subtractions to have comparable cost. You may need to use some tricks beyond the simple form A and B rules we have considered so far.

| $K$ | Shifts | Add/Subs | Expression          |
| :-- | :--    | :--      | :--                 |
|  6  | 2      | 1        | `(x<<2) + (x<<1)`     |
| 31  | 1      | 1        | `(x<<6) - x`         |
| -6  | 2      | 1        | `(x<<1) - (x<<3)`     |
| 55  | 2      | 2        | `(x<<6) - (x<<3) - x` |
