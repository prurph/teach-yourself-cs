# Practice Problem 2.10

As an application of the property that $a^a = 0$ for any bit vector $a$, consider the following program:

```c
void inplace_swap(int *x, int *y) {
  *y = *x ^ *y; /* Step 1 */
  *x = *x ^ *y; /* Step 2 */
  *y = *x ^ *y; /* Step 3 */
}
```

As the name implies, we claim that the effect of this procedure is to swap the values stored at the locations denoted by pointer variables `x` and `y`. Note that unlike the usual technique for swapping two values, we do not need a third location to temporarily store one value while we are moving the other. There is no performance advantage to this way of swapping; it is merely an intellectual amusement.

Starting with values $a$ and $b$ in the locations pointed to by `x` and `y`, respectively, fill in the table that follows, giving the values stored at the two locations after each step of the procedure. Use the properties of `^` to show that the desired effect is achieved. Recall that every element is its own additive inverse (that is, $a^a = 0$)

## Answer

Exclusive or is associative $(a^b)^ c = a^(b^c)$ and commutative $a^b = b^a$

| Step      | `*x`                   | `*y`                    |
| :--       | :--:                   | :--:                    |
| Initially | `a`                    | `b`                     |
| Step 1    | `a`                    | `a^b`                   |
| Step 2    | `(a^b)^a = (a^a)^b = b`| `a^b`                   |
| Step 3    | `b`                    | `b^(a^b) = a^(b^b) = a` |
