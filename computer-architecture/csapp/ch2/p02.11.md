# Practice Problem 2.11

Armed with the function `inplace_swap` from Problem 2.10, you decide to write code that will reverse the elements of an array by swapping elements from opposite ends of the array, workign toward the middle.

You arrive at the following function:

```c
void reverse_array(int a[], int cnt) {
  int first, last;
  for (first = 0, last = cnt-1;
       first <= last;
       first++, last--) {
      inplace_swap(&a[first], &a[last]);
    }
}
```

When you apply your function to an array containing elements, 1, 2, 3, and 4, you find the array now has, as expected, elements 4, 3, 2, and 1. When you try it on an array with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, however, you are surprised to see that the array now has elements 5, 4, 0, 2, and 1. In fact, you discover that the code always works correctly on arrays of even length, but it sets the middle element to 0 whenever the array has odd length.

## A

For an array of odd length $cnt = 2k + 1$, what are the values of variables `first` and `last` i n the final iteration of the function `reverse_array`?

### Answer

In the final iteration, `first = last = k`.

## B

Why does this call to function `inplace_swap` set the array element to 0.

### Answer

Since first and last are pointers to the same value, this is effectively `&a[mid] ^ &a[mid] = 0`

```c
void inplace_swap(int *x, int *y) {
  *y = *x ^ *y;  // *y = 0 and *x = 0 because x and y are the same element
  *x = *x ^ *y;  // *x = *x ^ 0 = *x = 0
  *y = *x ^ *y;  // *y = 0  ^ 0 = 0 
}
```

## C

What simple modification to the code for `reverse_array` would eliminate this problem?

### Answer

Change the loop condition to be `first < last`. There is no need to swap the middle element in an even-numbered array.
