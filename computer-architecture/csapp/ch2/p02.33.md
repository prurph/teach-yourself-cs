# Practice Problem 2.33

We can represent a bit pattern of length $w = 4$ with a single hex digit. For a two's-complement interpretation of these digits, fill in the following table to determine the additive inverses of the digits shown:

## Answer

To convert Decimal unsigned to two's-complement interpretation subtract $2^w$ (eg $F = 15U \rightarrow 15 - 16 = -1$)

| $x$ Hex | $x$ Decimal | $-_{4}^{t}\textrm{x}$ Decimal | $-_{4}^{t}\textrm{x}$ Hex |
| :--     | :--         | :--                           | :--                       |
| 0       |  0          |  0                            |  0                        |
| 5       |  5          | -5                            |  B                        |
| 8       | -8          | -8                            |  8                        |
| D       | -3          |  3                            |  3                        |
| F       | -1          |  1                            |  1                        |

The bit patterns generated by two's-complement and unsigned negation (Problem 2.28) are identical. This makes sense because the bit representations of the original numbers are identical, and addition operates identically at the bit level for signed and two's-complement, therefore the bit pattern that will represent the additive inverse of a number should be identical.
