# Practice Problem 2.49

## A

For a floating-point format with an $n$-bit fraction, give a formula for the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented exactly (because it would require an ($n+1$)-bit fraction to be exact). Assume the exponent field size $k$ is large enough that the range of representable exponents does not provide a limitation for this problem.

### Answer

$V = (-1)^s \times M \times 2^E$, so we are looking for $M$ that cannot fit in $n$ fractional bits. This will be a normalized number, meaning the 1 will be implied in the fractional bits, so for this number $M = 1.000...01$ with $n+1$ fractional bits. This gives:

$V = 1.000...01 \times 2^(n+1) = 2^(n+1) + 1$

An easier way to think of this is that the binary representation is 1, $n$ zeros, then a 1. This is actually $n+2$ total bits, but recall the leading one bit is implied in the floating point representation.

## B

What is the numeric value of this integer for single-precision format ($n = 23$)?

### Answer

Substituting, $V = 2^24 + 1 = 16777217$
