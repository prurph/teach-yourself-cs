# Practice Problem 2.23

Consider the following C functions:

```
int fun1(unsigned word) {
    return (int) ((word << 24) >> 24);
}

int fun2(unsigned word) {
    return ((int) word << 24) >> 24;
}
```

Assume these are executed as a 32-bit program on a machine that uses two's complement arithmetic. Assume also that right shifts of signed values are performed arithmetically, while right shifts of unsigned values are performed logically.

## A

Fill in the following table showing the effect of these functions for several example arguments. You will find it more conveneient to work with a hexadecimal representation. Just remember that hex digits `8` through `F` have their most significant bits equal to 1.

### Answer

For `fun1`, shifting happens on an unsigned value, so the shift back to the right is a logical shift, and zeros are prepended.

For `fun2`, shifting happens on a signed value, so the shift back to the right is an arithmetic shift. If the most significant bit is 1 (`8` through `F`), the shift prepends ones (`0xF`).

| `w`        | `fun1(w)`  | `fun2(w)`  |
| :--        | :--        | :--        |
| 0x00000076 | 0x00000076 | 0x00000076 |
| 0x87654321 | 0x00000021 | 0x00000021 |
| 0x000000C9 | 0x000000C9 | 0xFFFFFFC9 |
| 0xEDCBA987 | 0x00000087 | 0xFFFFFF87 |

## B

Describe in words the useful computation each of these functions performs.

### Answer

`fun1` masks the lower byte, giving a value between 0 and 255 $w \mod 2^8$

`fun2` masks the lower byte, but maintains its sign, giving a value between -128 and 127. This is the two's complement representation of the output of `fun1`: $(w \mod 2^8) - 2^8$.
