# Practice Problem 2.13

The Digital Equipment VAX computer was a very popular machin from the late 1970s until the late 1980s. Rather than instructions for Boolean operations `AND` and `OR`, it had instructions `bis` (bit set) and `bic` (bit clear). Both instructions take a data word `x` and a mask word `m`. They generate a result `z` consisting of the bits of `x` modified according to the bits of `m`. With `bis`, the modification involves setting `z` to 1 at each bit position where `m` is 1. With `bic`, the modification involves setting `z` to 0 at each bit position where `m` is 1.

To see how these operations relate to the C bit-level operations, assume we have functions `bis` and `bic` implementing the bit set and bit clear operations, and taht we want to use these to implement functions computing bitwise operations `|` and `^`, without using any other C operations. Fill in the missing code below. *Hint:* Write C expressions for the operations `bis` and `bic`.

## Answer

```c
/* Declarations of functions implementing operations bis and bic */
int bis(int x, int m); // x | m
int bic(int x, int m); // x & ~m

/* Compute x|y using only calls to functions bis and bic */
int bool_or(int x, int y) {
    int result = bis(x, y);
    return result;
}

/* Compute x^y using only calls to functions bis and bic */
int bool_xor(int x, int y) {
  bic(x, y) // only x is 1
  bic(y, x) // only y is 1
    // bic(x, y) sets x to 1 only where y is 0
    // bic(y, x) sets y to 1 only where x is 0 (note above mutation doesn't affect this)
    // Union these two with bis
    // Overall this is using x ^ y = (x & ~y) | (~x & y)
    int result = bis(bic(x, y), bic(y, x));
    return result;
}
```
