# Practice Problem 2.12

Write C expressions in terms of variable `x`, for the following values. Your code should work for any word size $w \ge 8$. For reference, we show the result of evaluating the expressions for `x = 0x87654321`, with $w = 32$.

## A

The least significant byte of `x` with all other bits set to 0. [`0x00000021`]

### Answer

`x & 0xFF`

## B

All but the least significant byte of `x` complemented, with the least significant byte left unchanged. [`0x789ABC21`]

### Answer

`x ^ ~0xFF` 

XOR with all ones is the same as the complement. XOR with zeros is the identity. Thus we can XOR x with 1111...1 0000 0000 with only the last byte unmasked to get the desired result.

`~0` is all 1s, so `~0xFF` is all ones except for the first byte.

## C

The least significant byte set to all ones, and all other bytes of x left unchanged.

### Answer

`x | 0xFF`
