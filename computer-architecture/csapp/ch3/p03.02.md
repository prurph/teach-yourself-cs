# Practice Problem 3.2

For each of the following lines of assembly language, determine the appropriate instruction suffix based on the operands. (For example, `mov` can be rewritten as `movb`, `movw`, `movl`, or `movq`.)

## Answer

```asm
movl   %eax, (%rsp)
movw   (%rax), %dx
movb   $0xFF, %bl
movb   (%rsp,%rdcx,4), %dl
movq   (%rdx), %rax
movb   %dx, (%rax)
```
