# Practice Problem 3.4

Assume variables `sp` and `dp` are declared with types

```c
src_t  *sp;
dest_t *dp;
```

where `src_t` and `dest_t` are datatypes declared with `typedef`. We wish to use the appropriate pair of data movement instructions to implement the operation

```c
*dp = (dest_t) *sp;
```

Assume that the values of `sp` and `dp` are stored in registers `%rdi` and `%rsi,` respectively. For each entry in the table, show the two instructions that implement the specified data movement. The first instruction in the sequence should read from memory, do the appropriate conversion, and set the appropriate portion of register `%rax.` The second instruction should then write the appropriate portion of `%rax` to memory. In both cases, the portions may be `%rax,` `%eax,` `%ax,` or `%al,` and they may differ from one another.

Recall that when performing a cast that involves both a size change and a change of "signedness" in C, the operation should change the size first (Section 2.2.6).

## Answer

Generally, when the source is unsigned _and_ there is a size increase, we use the `movz` instructions to zero-extend, otherwise we use the `movs` to sign-extend if there is a size increase. If there is no size increase, or there is a decrease, then regular `mov` instructions are sufficient: see `int` to `char`.

Instructions for pairs of `src_t`, `dest_t` types:

```c
# long / long
movq    (%rdi), %rax
movq    %rax, (%rsi)

# char / int
movsbl  (%rdi), %eax    # convert char to int with sign-extended move byte to long
movl    %eax, (%rsi)    # write 4 bytes for int return

# char / unsigned
movsbl  (%rdi), %eax    # same char to int conversion because destination is signed
movl    %eax, (%rsi)    # write 4 bytes for (unsigned) int return

# unsigned char / long
movzbl  (%rdi), %eax    # read byte, zero extend because source is unsigned
movq    %rdx, (%rsi)    # write 8 bytes

# int / char
movl    (%rdi), %eax    # read 4-byte int
movb    %al, (%rsi)     # store single byte for char

# unsigned / unsigned char
movl    (%rdi), %eax    # read 4-byte unsigned
movb    %al, (%rsi)     # store low-order byte for char

# char / short
movsbw  (%rdi), %ax     # read byte, sign extend
movw    %ax, (%rsi)     # store two bytes for short return
```
