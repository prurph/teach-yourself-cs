# Practice Problem 3.3

Each of the following lines of code generates an error message when we invoke the assembler. Explain what is wrong with each line.

## Answer

Note the second-to-last line has a typo in the question. It should be `%dx` as the destination, not `%rdx`

```asm
movb   $0xF, (%ebx)   # Addresses are always referred to as quad, so (%rbx)
movl   %rax, (%rsp)   # movl with quad operand
movw   (%rax),4(%rsp) # Source and destination cannot both be memory references
movb   %al,%sl        # No such register as %sl
movq   %rax,$0x123    # Destination cannot be literal value
movl   %eax,%dx       # movl with word-sized destination
movb   %si, 8(%rbp)   # movb with word-sized source
```
